However, this also happens without this change.\n\n\nThe test is conducted in the following way:\n\n* The kernel module binary is downloaded from http://ab/P68473610/ and is placed under the `kernel/prebuilts/common-modules/virtual-device/5.10/x86-64` folder.\n* Verified in the kernel debugfs log under `/sys/kernel/debug/dri/0/virtio-gpu-features` that the \"create guest handle\" line is removed.\n* Use the `sc-gsi-with-phones-release` branch defined here: https://source.corp.google.com/piper///depot/google3/configs/wireless/android/busytown/platform/git_sc/git_sc-gsi-with-phones-release.gcl;l\u003d1;rcl\u003d504599932\n* `lunch cf_x86_64_phone-userdebug`\n* Run the correspondent `launch_cvd` command.",

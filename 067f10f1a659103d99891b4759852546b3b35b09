      "message": "Hi Alistair,\n\nIt\u0027s simple to cherry-pick this change to both android-4.19-stable, and android12-5.4, but it is not trivial to cherry-pick this change to android-4.14-stable. The virtio-gpu driver there is too old. If I have to keep 4.14 stable branch in sync, I need to be able to test it locally when I make the change. It would be better if I don\u0027t have to cherry-pick this change to 4.14.",

      "message": "The driver should be the same. I think you might be confused because cherry-picking isn\u0027t possible due to file renaming. Just rename the files in your history, commit it, cherry-pick this change, and then rename them back. Then you can squash the renames with git rebase -i and amend the final commit with git commit -C \u003cmiddle commit\u003e --amend",

      "message": "Thanks for looking on this. I will try and answer your questions:\n1. Currently this is only for aarch64 as this is implemented in crosvm only for this arch but I don\u0027t see any reason why it wouldn\u0027t work in the future for x86. As long as the guest provides /proc/stat/::guest_info.\n\n2. I added some tests recently as part of the crosvm backend implementation(for reference : https://chromium-review.googlesource.com/c/crosvm/crosvm/+/3872276) . To test a stalling guest it will be a bit more complicated because you will need a custom guest kernel image that can trigger this condition.\nLet me know what do you think of this.\n\nCheers",

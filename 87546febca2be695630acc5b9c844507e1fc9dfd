The upstream version of this change handles the exit correctly.\n\nThis change fixes a bug in the kernel that can hang SurfaceFlinger at boot.\n\nMany 5.10 branches suffer from this bug, e.g. `android12-5.10`, `android13-5.10`, `main-16k-gs-raviole-5.10`, `trout-android12-5.10`, while the 5.4 branches(the problematic CL isn\u0027t merged yet) and 5.15 branches(correctly use the upstream version of the CL) are not affected. Should I also cherry-pick this change to other branches?",

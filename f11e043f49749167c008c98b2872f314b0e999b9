Perhaps this is //common:kernel_aarch64_gdb_scripts, maybe?",

      "message": "The fragment config is an implementation detail to CF\u0027s kgdb build. By that I mean, perhaps for a different device, to enable --kgdb, adding a fragment config might not be enough.\n\nMaybe you are suggesting that, instead of using PRE_DEFCONFIG_CMDS / POST_DEFCONFIG_CMDS in build configs, we should express fragment configs in `BUILD` files directly? I think that\u0027s a problem orthogonal to the implementation of --kgdb (tracked in b/236012223).",

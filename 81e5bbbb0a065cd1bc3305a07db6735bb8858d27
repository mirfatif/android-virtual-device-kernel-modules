      "message": "Why not just make a dtbo that disables the BT node? You could do this:\n\n1) Create the file rk3399-rock-pi-4b-no-bt.dtsi that looks like this:\n\n  \u0026uart0 {\n    status \u003d \"disabled\";\n  };\n\n2) Then in the Makefile do this:\n\n  rk3399-rock-pi-4b-no-bt-dtbs :\u003d rk3399-rock-pi-4b.dtb rk3399-rock-pi-4b-no-bt.dtbo\n  dtb-y +\u003d rk3399-rock-pi-4b-no-bt.dtb\n\nThe build will create \"rk3399-rock-pi-no-bt.dtb\" which should have the overlay applied. You should be able to use that directly instead of rk3399-rock-pi-4b.dtb.",

      "message": "I think it\u0027s a good idea, but the problem is we have no \u0027Makefile\u0027 to patch, since we don\u0027t want to touch the ACK one and rockpi is built from the ACK tree directly. I think the dtbo approach could work instead, but it would require some changes to the FIT packing process - which is worth investigating.",
